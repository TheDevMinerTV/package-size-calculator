# Package Size Calculator

A simple tool to calculate the size of an NPM package. This tool installs the package in a Docker container to ensure that any potentially malicious packages do not affect your system.

## Installation

You can download the pre-built binaries from the [Releases page](https://github.com/TheDevMinerTV/package-size-calculator/releases).

### Additional Flags

- `--npm-cache <DIRECTORY>`: Specifies a directory to use as the NPM cache. Defaults to a temporary directory if not specified.
